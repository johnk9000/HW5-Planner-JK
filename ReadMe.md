## WORK DAY PLANNER

URL: johnk9000.github.io/HW5-Planner-JK/

# Overview
Created a dynamic planner app that will record your day's activities even if the browser is refreshed. It will erase if you exit the browser.

The planner has been made with a default 16 hour day starting at 8 am.  Adjusting the time and length of the workday will be implmented in a later release.

The planner updates where it will grab the local time and highlight the current hour with future hours tinted slightly.  Passed hours are blurred out but that can be disabled.
